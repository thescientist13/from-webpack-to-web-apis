1. Why Webpack
    - no module specification for the browser
    - dev server / HMR
    - all in one solution (as JavaScript...)
    - but... (and not meming on it) maybe it led us astray (code snippet of good vs bad imports)
1. Why Not Webpack?
    - ESM is a thing
    - Browsers have come a long way!
    - Full-Stack Web Standards (WinterCG)
1. Web APIs
    - ESM w/ code snippet (static analysis benefits and lets the browser do the heavy lifting - no dev server)
    - Import Maps w/ code snippet
    - Import Assertions w/ code snippet
    - URL + `import.meta.url` w/ code snippet
    - (Bonus) CSS Custom Properties / Nesting w/ code snippets
1. Demo
    - no bundle development
    - import maps
    - JSON / CSS import assertions
    - image loading
    - CSS variables and nesting
1. Closing
    - browser compat
    - to bundle or not to bundle?
    - "native" [HMR over ESM](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-hmr.html)
